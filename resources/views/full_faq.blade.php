                                <p>Of course you can. Everything is negotiable. But be respectful and understanding that everyone has a business to run and livelihood to make.

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Requests made that do not apply to the services you offer</li>

                                <p>When a client sends a message to you, the expected behavior is to receive a response back from you. For this reason, no direct email address will be provided. When you reply to a message, the client will instantly receive an email from us with your message. And your correspondence will be kept safely in the thread on that page for both parties to see.</p>

                                <p>It’s pretty simple actually. When you receive a message you’re interested in, just respond by sending a quote back. We’ll send that over to the client and if they like what they see, they’ll accept your quote and confirm final details. Then it’s booked! All that’s left is for you to show up, do your thing and get paid upfront!</p>

Just ask the reviewer to edit their review by contacting us (from the same email address they used to post the review) stating the details of the change they’d like to make. We know this might be a bit of a pain, but we do this to uphold the integrity of the reviews on ScoutMee.</p>

                                <p>You may dispute reviews only if they are obscene, abusive, or fraudulent. If a review you receive meets one of the above, then it can be disputed. When you select to dispute a review, it will be held for arbitration while we review your information and possibly contact the reviewer for fact-checking. If facts check out, you will be given an opportunity to work out your differences with the reviewer and if mutually agreed, the review can be removed.</p>
